# Rock-Classification-Multiple-Models

This project focuses on rock classification using supervised machine learning models. The dataset, sourced from aggregateRockData-1.xlsx, undergoes preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure data quality and proper feature selection.

## The notebook includes:

### Data Preprocessing: 
Loading, cleaning, and structuring rock classification data.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Visualizing distributions, correlations, and key patterns.
### Model Training & Evaluation:
Implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.
Comparing model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Analyzing feature importance and classification accuracy.
